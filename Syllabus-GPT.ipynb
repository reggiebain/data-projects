    "# Introducing Specific Context to OpenAI - Course Syllabus\n",
    "- In this notebook, we will write methods to allow ChatGPT to answer questions given context about a particular text. In this case, this will be a course syllabus.\n",
    "- Using the OpenAI tutorial on prompt engineering as a guide, we will create methods to embed the syllabus divided into sections, relate a given prompt about the syllabus to the most closely related sections of the syllabus, and have the engine provide a more targeted answer to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Goals\n",
    "1. Write script to parse any syllabus and put into useful form.\n",
    "2. Fine tune GPT model on transcripts from Zoom recordings of classes to answer content questions"
